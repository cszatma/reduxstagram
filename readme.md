# Reduxstagram

Implementation of Wes Bos' [Learn Redux](https://learnredux.com/) course.

## Running

**Note**: I use yarn instead of npm. You can however replace the following yarn commands with npm and it should work fine.

First `yarn install` to grab all the necessary dependencies. 

Then run `yarn start` and open <localhost:7770> in your browser.

## Production Build

Run `yarn build` to create a distro folder and a bundle.js file.
